            <td class="s4" dir="ltr">Each stance, or basic attitude toward meaningness, is a transient pattern of
                thinking, feeling, and acting. The Meaningness practice involves learning to recognize these patterns.
                Then you know what stance you are in at any moment, and ways to shift from any confused stance to a
                complete one.
            </td>
            <td class="s4" dir="ltr">A confused stance is based on an underlying mistaken metaphysical assumption. The
                assumption is usually unthought: not understood, or entirely outside awareness. Typically the assumption
                draws a distinction that is a false dilemma; so confused stances mainly come in pairs, which share the
                underlying assumption but take opposite sides of it.<br><br>Surfacing the assumption, and seeing how it
                is wrong, makes it possible to understand and adopt the corresponding complete stance.
            </td>
            <td class="s4" dir="ltr">Each confused stance wrongly denies something about meaningness, and fixates
                something else. Stances allied with eternalism deny the nebulosity of a dimension of meaningness, and
                fixate a pattern. Stances allied with nihilism deny the pattern and fixate the dimension’s
                non-existence.<br><br>Recognizing how nebulosity and pattern work together moves one into the complete
                stance for that dimension.
            </td>
            <td class="s4" dir="ltr">When you adopt a stance, a characteristic texture of thinking, feeling, and perhaps
                acting comes with it. The stance makes that way of being seem sensible. Also, that way of being makes
                the stance seem sensible.
                <br>
                <br>For example, nihilism usually makes you depressed. Likewise, when you are depressed for other
                reasons, nihilism may seem obviously right.
            </td>
            <td class="s4" dir="ltr">The “sales pitch” is a slogan that encapsulates the language used to promote the
                stance.
                <br>
                <br>A confused stance’s emotional appeal is the reason it is attractive. Each confused stance plays to
                some need for security, excitement, or self-aggrandizement.
                <br>
                <br>Noticing that you are getting sucked in by the emotional promise made by a confused stance, and
                knowing that it cannot deliver on them, helps free you from it.
                <br>
                <br>The complete stances are, unfortunately, less emotionally appealing. (Otherwise, we’d adopt them
                easily.) However, they are more realistic.
            </td>
            <td class="s4" dir="ltr">Confused stances distort experience by fixating and denying particular sorts of
                meaningness. When these mistaken perceptions collide with reality, emotional pain results.
                <br>
                <br>Each confused stance produces a characteristic pattern of misunderstanding and misery.
            </td>
            <td class="s4" dir="ltr">The confused stances constantly collide with reality. It is impossible not to see
                this, and impossible not to suffer the consequences. This makes it impossible to remain consistently in
                a confused stance; they are always unstable.
                <br>
                <br>A confused stance’s patterns of collision with reality—the obstacles to maintaining it—are resources
                for switching into a complete stance.
                <br>
                <br>Unfortunately there are obstacles to adopting the complete stances, as well. Generally, complete
                stances are conceptually obscure, and appear emotionally unsatisfying.
            </td>
            <td class="s4" dir="ltr">Because stances are unstable, we frequently stumble from one to another, without
                being clearly aware that we are doing this. In fact, all of the confused stances described in this book
                will be thoroughly familiar to every reader.
                <br>
                <br>When a particular obstacle to maintaining one stance arises, there are typical routes into likely
                next stances. Knowing this, one can recognize an upcoming transition into a confused stance, and
                re-direct oneself into a complete stance instead.
            </td>
            <td class="s4" dir="ltr">These are ways of getting yourself out of a confused stance.
                <br>
                <br>Simply recognizing that you are caught in one, and remembering that there is a better alternative,
                is often most of the battle.
                <br>
                <br>Beyond that, one can notice particular confused patterns, and cut through them with specific
                counter-thoughts.1 Counter-thoughts can work in two ways. Some move from a confused stance to the
                complete stance. Others destabilize the confused stance, to make it less attractive so that you are more
                likely to jump to the complete stance spontaneously. (In those cases, though, one needs to guard against
                simply moving to a different confused stance.)
            </td>
            <td class="s4" dir="ltr">Each confused stance is intelligent in some way. If it did not have a powerful
                logic to it, an almost-truth, we would not get stuck in it. Each approximates a complete stance, which
                is actually correct.
                <br>
                <br>Noticing how the confused stance you have adopted is nearly right is helpful in several ways:
                <br>
                <br> • It avoids “I’m a bad person because I fell into a confused stance again,” which is discouraging,
                and more likely to make you abandon the practice than to continue.
                <br> • It lets you see why you’ve adopted it.
                <br> • It helps point the way to a complete stance that shares the same accurate insight.
                <br> • It is the basis for appropriation—the use of a confused stance to communicate the corresponding
                complete stance.
